# AS91263 Questionnaire

This document provides a questionnaire based on the AS91263 standard, which is used for quality management in the aerospace industry. The questions are designed to assess compliance with the standard's requirements.

## Section 1: Quality Management System

1. **Does your organization have a documented quality management system (QMS)?**
   - Yes
   - No

2. **Is the QMS regularly reviewed and updated?**
    - Yes
    - No

There is an application in this page that lays out the assessment and then I am now including the questions in the R Markdown format.
