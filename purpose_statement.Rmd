# Notes on Writing a Purpose Statement (AS91263)

## 1. What is a Purpose Statement?

It's the main **GOAL** of your investigation. For your assessment, it goes in the **Introduction** of your report.

A good purpose statement guides ALL your decisions and clearly states:
* **WHAT** you want to find out (your research objectives).
* **WHO** the research is for (your audience or client, e.g., the Student Council).
* **WHOM** you are finding it out about (your target population).
* **HOW** your audience could use the data you gather.

## 2. The Recipe (Key Ingredients)

Your purpose needs to link everything together. Make sure you clearly identify:

* **The Audience:** Who is it FOR? How will they USE the data?
* **The Purpose/Goal:** WHAT do you want to find out? (Is it a **comparison** or a **relationship**?).
* **The Population:** WHO are you asking? Be specific (e.g., time, place, age).
* **The Variables:** What specific data or information will you collect?

## 3. The Template (How to Write It)

Start with your audience to guide your thinking.

#### For a COMPARISON:
```
On behalf of [The Audience], I want to investigate the difference in the [Variable to measure] between [Group 1] and [Group 2] for the population of [Your Population].
```

#### For a RELATIONSHIP:
```
On behalf of [The Audience], I want to investigate if there is a relationship between [Variable 1] and [Variable 2] for the population of [Your Population].
```

    +   **Purpose:** To investigate if there is a relationship between having a part-time job and savings habits for the population of Year 12 students at our school.

## 5. Your First Checklist (Checkpoint One)

Before writing any questions, you must have this information ready for your report:

- [ ] **CONTEXT & GOAL:** Have you defined the context of your investigation and your research objectives?
- [ ] **AUDIENCE & USE:** Have you explained who your audience is and how the data can be used by them?
- [ ] **TARGET POPULATION:** Have you clearly defined your target population?
- [ ] **DATA:** Have you explained what data your questionnaire will gather to meet the purpose?

## 6. A Note on Grades

* **Merit:** Requires **justification**. You need to explain *why* you made your design choices, such as why the data will be useful for your chosen audience.
* **Excellence:** Requires **statistical insight**. This involves linking statistical and contextual knowledge to the purpose, for example, by explaining how your questions build on each other to better achieve your goal.
